# VR Asset Chain

A decentralized system for registering, verifying ownership, and trading digital assets in virtual reality environments.

## Overview

VR Asset Chain provides a trustless infrastructure for managing digital assets in the metaverse. It enables creators, developers, and users to:

- Mint VR assets (3D models, environments, avatars, accessories) as unique digital tokens
- Trade assets securely with built-in royalty support
- Maintain verifiable ownership and provenance records
- Integrate with VR platforms through standardized metadata
- Manage usage rights and transfer permissions

## Architecture

The system is built around a central registry contract that handles asset registration, ownership management, and marketplace functionality.

    B -->|Store| E[Asset Data]
    B -->|Store| F[Metadata]
    B -->|Track| G[Transfer History]
    B -->|Manage| H[Marketplace Listings]
```

### Core Components
- Asset Registry: Maintains core asset data and ownership
- Metadata Storage: Stores detailed asset information and compatibility data
- Transfer History: Tracks provenance with up to 10 most recent transfers
- Marketplace: Handles listings and secure transactions with royalty distribution

## Contract Documentation

### VR Asset Registry Contract

The main contract managing all VR asset operations.

#### Key Features
- Asset registration with detailed metadata
- Ownership transfers and history tracking
- Marketplace functionality with automated royalties
- Ownership verification for VR platforms
- Metadata update capabilities

#### Access Control
- Asset modifications restricted to current owners
- Creator royalties automatically enforced
- Transfer restrictions configurable per asset

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Clarinet
- Stacks wallet
- STX tokens for transactions

### Basic Usage

1. **Register a new VR asset**
```clarity
(contract-call? .vr-asset-registry register-asset
    "https://metadata.url"
    "Asset Name"
    "Description"
    {x: u100, y: u100, z: u100}
    (list "Platform1" "Platform2")
    "PG"
    "GLB"
    true
    u50)
```

2. **List asset for sale**
```clarity
(contract-call? .vr-asset-registry list-asset-for-sale asset-id price)
```

3. **Purchase asset**
```clarity
(contract-call? .vr-asset-registry purchase-asset asset-id)
```

## Development

### Testing
1. Clone the repository
2. Install Clarinet
3. Run tests:
```bash
clarinet test
```

### Local Development

```clarity
(contract-call? .vr-asset-registry ...)
```

## Security Considerations

### Limitations
- Transfer history limited to 10 most recent transfers
- Maximum royalty percentage of 50%
- Metadata string length restrictions

### Best Practices
- Verify asset ownership before integration
- Check transferability status before transactions
- Validate metadata URL authenticity
- Handle royalty distributions correctly
- Monitor transfer events for asset tracking
